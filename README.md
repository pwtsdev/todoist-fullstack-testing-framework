# Todoist Fullstack Testing Framework

Welcome to the **Todoist Fullstack Testing Framework** repository ‚Äì built by [@bkita](https://github.com/bkita).

This project demonstrates comprehensive testing of the Todoist application using **Playwright** with **TypeScript**, covering both UI and API testing scenarios.

This repo contains smoke tests, API tests, and advanced test automation patterns for testing a real-world application with proper setup hooks, fixtures, and CI/CD integration.

## What This Project Covers

This project demonstrates **fullstack testing** with a focus on real-world scenarios:

- **UI Testing** with Playwright (project creation, task management, search functionality)
- **API Testing** for backend validation and test data setup
- **Advanced Test Patterns** including fixtures, page objects, and global hooks
- **CI/CD Integration** with GitHub Actions
- **Environment Configuration** for local and cloud execution

You'll see practical examples of testing patterns like test data cleanup via API, authentication handling, and comprehensive smoke test coverage.

By exploring this project, you'll understand how to **build maintainable and reliable test suites** for modern web applications.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you'll need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v20 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- A Todoist account for testing

---

## Setup

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pwtsdev/todoist-fullstack-testing-framework.git
   cd todoist-fullstack-testing-framework
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with your credentials:

   ```env
   USER_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
   USER_PASSWORD=your-password
   API_KEY=your-api-key
   LOGGER=false
   ```

## Running Tests

### Local Execution

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in headed mode
npm run test:headed

# Run tests in debug mode
npm run test:debug

# Run tests with UI mode
npm run test:ui

# Skip linting and run tests directly
npm run test:nolint
```

### Lint and Type Check

```bash
# Run TypeScript check and ESLint
npm run pretest
```

### View Reports

```bash
# Show test report
npm run show-report
```
